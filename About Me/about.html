          <p>My name is Azimas Perwata Saputra, i'm Front-End Developer. I recognize Programming Language since i'm 12 Years old, i'am inspired to become Developer because i was interested in how the game i played worked. The first Programming Language i learn is Python for Game Developing and MySQL for Game Databases.</p>
          <p>I learn those Program Language from youtuber named "Putu Suhartawan", I've been Developer in GTA San Andreas Multiplayer Indonesian server and become Mapper/Designer. My Journey in GTA SA(MP) developing only lasted, and then i was interested how to create a websites. After doing some research about Program Language used to create website and i looked for a Youtuber who shared Website Developing Course and found one youtuber named "Dea Afrizal"</p>
